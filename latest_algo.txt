Y calculation

	exact_no_years_lived = (py-by)-1  //exact number of years passed excluding py and by, we are excluding py and by as they are not a complete year.
								here we are assuming the by and py are not completely lived to get counted.
								May be some days/months are passed or need to be passed to become a complete year.




M and D calculation

	//calculating months in by
	if date == 1   //consider this whole month  is lived 1-3-1995

	else    //2-3-1995
		no_months_lived_in_by = (12 - bm)  excluding the birth month as it is not a complete month
		no_days_lived_in_bm =  no_days_in_month - bd + 1  here I am including the birth day even if the day is lived for less than 24 hours

	//calculating months in py
	if date != 1     // consider the whole month is not lived 2-3-2020
		no_months_lived_in_py = pm - 1     //excliuding this  pm as it is not a complete month    (4m,2d) 1-2-3-4
